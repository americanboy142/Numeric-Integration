 I integraded both experiments into the main HW2 file, but results go to ""_2.csv to keep assigned data.

 because all but the normal distrobution have actual value of 0, there is a lot of divide by zero errors. This causes some weird errors, because log(0) is undifined
 but for the real data we can still see that gaussian get the closest and basically exact up to e^-16.
