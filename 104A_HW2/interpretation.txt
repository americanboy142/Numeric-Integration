It is clear from the the data that Gaussian quadurature is the best, for these tests. With n = 2 it returns a number that is very close to exact,
where the others either require n = 512 or n = 256, to be close. this makes sence because you have to do the most work on each iteration for Gaussian,
and the weights are fixed and know before a single iteration. Simposons rule might have the most complex formula but Gaussian requires the most work to acheive
a workable function. From IntegrandMethod it is easy to conferm that gaussian converges the quickest as well.
