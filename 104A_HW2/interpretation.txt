It is clear from the the data that Gaussian quadurature is the best, for these tests. With n = 2 it returns a number that is very close to exact,
where the others either require n = 512 or n = 256, to be close. this makes sence because you have to do the most work on each iteration for Gaussian,
and the weights are fixed and know before a single iteration. Simposons rule might have the most complex formula but Gaussian requires the most work to acheive
a workable function. From IntegrandMethod it is easy to conferm that gaussian converges the quickest as well. 
The weired error at the end of gaussian, at n=128 it gets the exact number (or atleast the exact to what the computer is able to see, with default settings)
this causes the error convergece for n>=128 to be ints rather then floats.


EXTRA EXPERIMENT: i had 11 files so 
 I integraded both experiments into the main HW2 file, but results go to ""_2.csv to keep assigned data.

 because all but the normal distrobution have actual value of 0, there is a lot of divide by zero errors. This causes some weird errors, because log(0) is undifined
 but for the real data we can still see that gaussian get the closest and basically exact up to e^-16.
